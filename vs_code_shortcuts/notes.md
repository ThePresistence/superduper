### 1. VS CODE SHORTCUTS FOR LINUX 
* Check the resources section for linux shortcut pdf. 
* Single click to the file is temporary, double click the file is robust. 
* Use zen mode. 
* You can activate zen mode my **chord mode**. press 'ctrl+k', then release, then press "k". 
* If you want multiple cursors for all substrings. Go the string and click "ctrl+d", it will add another cursor with the another substring. 


#### More: 
* Shift + End 
* ctrl + shift + > 
* shift + > 
* alt + shift + > and press down arrows and up arrow for moving. ( cool )
* alt + up arrow or down arrow to change the current line to up or down. 
* alt + shift + down (for duplicating the exact line down)
* ctrl + alt + up or down arrow (for multiple cursors)
* hold + alt + click where to you want ( for multiple cursors where you want)
* ctrl + space (to auto completion to appear. pretty useless stuff)
* 
 

### 2. Extensions 
* VS code lags in autocompletion, so have auto completion you can install "python" extension. 
* Then you type "shift + ctrl + space" for awesome auto completion. 
* INstall "Pylance". Pylance is a language server, which is basically a program that running all the time when we run the vs code. And the language server constantly scans our code as we make changes and it identifies the various tokens and then uses the result of that analysis to decide how syntax highlighting should happen and auto completion. 
* If you want to rename only the function and the function reference use **rename symbol (F2)** by right clicking the function name, it just changes all the function references.
