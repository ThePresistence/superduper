# Type hints

## 1. History

* In python 3.5, a new feature was added to Python.

    ```python
    variable: int=25  # type annotations
    ```

* By using type annotations in your software project, the code that you write is going to be a lot more maintainable and it'll be far more likely people will actually want to adopt software libraries that you write.
