# Write clean and efficient code :) 

## 1. Clean code âœ¨

* You should write the code in **idiomatic** way. Idiomatic means in software is whether or not your code conforms to standard style patterns for whatever the language or framework is that you're working on. Like proper variable name case for function, classes and constonts.
* In python, we have a special name of **idiomatic** code, that is called **pythonic** way. !!
* In software engineering interviews, some times people will check the way you written the code. So you should write the code in pythonic way !!
* Clean code means 
    - Easy to change, understand, safe/secure, relevant, and highly subjective.
    - Redability is the one of the key characteristics of clean code.
* You should use this principle called **refactoring** for better readability in code.  -> which is basically means incremental changes to make code more redable than it was when you first started. If you want to read a book for this you can read this book: <i>Refactoring improving the design of existing code</i>.
* If you're having stronger desire to write cleaner code, it will take years to achieve that. ONce you're able to write clean code, you will spend less time in debugging, better software, better at interviews and this is the organized way of designing.
* In few years, it will be possible python won't be there, people might use some other programming language but Principiles of clean code will never change. This is the crux of the programming language.

## 2. Python style guides

* Python has something called [**PEP8**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) style guide. Basically python language is maintained by community and the community has a group called **steering council**. You can go to pep8 org for checking the python sytle guides and the proposals. 
* Again Python has some other styling guide by google called [**Google python style guide**](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html). It's has become super popular. (most recommandable way!!)

## 3. Refractoring the code

* which is basically means incremental changes to make code more redable than it was when you first started.
* Refractoring is a skill it needs repeated practice to master. 
* Please read this [ðŸ˜Œ<-click](https://testdriven.io/blog/clean-code-python/) for how to write a clean python code.
