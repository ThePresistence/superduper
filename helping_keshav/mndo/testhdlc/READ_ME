Computation times on Compaq XP1000:
----------------------------------

The test suite hdlc1a-hdlc6a needs about 120 sec of cpu time.
Major contributors with cpu times greater than 5 sec:
hdlc2b:     27 SECONDS  including    25 SECONDS for HDLC part
hdlc2e:     22 SECONDS  including    20 SECONDS for HDLC part
hdlc3a:      5 SECONDS  including     4 SECONDS for HDLC part
hdlc3c:      7 SECONDS  including     6 SECONDS for HDLC part
hdlc5b:     33 SECONDS  including    11 SECONDS for HDLC part
hdlc6a:     15 SECONDS  including     8 SECONDS for HDLC part

The remaining test jobs require more cpu time (data from 2001).
hdlc6b:    109 SECONDS  including    58 SECONDS for HDLC part
hdlc8a:   4121 SECONDS  including  1813 SECONDS for HDLC part
hdlc8b:  11327 SECONDS  including  8686 SECONDS for HDLC part
hdlc9a:    210 SECONDS  including    61 SECONDS for HDLC part

a) The results from different optimizers are compatible.
b) The standard optimizers (FLEPO, TSOPT) exploit symmetry.
   HDLCOPT does not yet make use of symmetry.
   This may explain the higher number of SCF calls for tetracene.
c) TS H2CO->HCHO: The comparison of job3g (EIGF) vs. job3d (TSOPT)
   shows the superiority of eigenvector following over gradient
   norm minimization (11 vs. 27 SCF calls). HDLCOPT also uses
   eigenvector following (PRFO, hdlc1d); the higher number of
   SCF calls compared with job3g (19 vs. 11) is largely due to
   the use of two-sided rather than one-sided differentiation
   when computing the numerical Hessian for the 5 optimized
   variables (10 vs 5 SCF calls).
