1.    Standard test jobs (from ~/mndo99/testjobs)
      -------------------------------------------

      There are 50 input files for test jobs which are designed to
      cover most of the major options in the program. These jobs are
      grouped as follows.

      job1*: Single-point SCF energy calculations for different methods.
      job2*: Single-point SCF energy and gradient calculations.
      job3*: SCF geometry optimizations and transition state searches.
      job4*: Force constant analysis (combined with optimizations).
      job5*: Reaction paths and grids.
      job6*: Calculations with correlated wave functions.
      job7*: Property evaluations.
      job8*: Special features.

      Options for running the standard test jobs:
      ------------------------------------------
      
      The current implementation of integral-direct linear-scaling methods
      using full matrices has the following limitations.

      Integral-direct mode (intdir=1) does not work for:
      - Methods with orthogonalization corrections (OMx).
      - Electron correlation.
      - COSMO solvation treatment.
      - External point charges in SCF.

      Linear-scaling CG-DMS mode (lindms=1) does not work for:
      - Open-shell systems.

      Linear-scaling CG-DMS mode requires:
      - Final eigenvectors (lindia=1) for properties etc.
      - Special initial density guess (linfrg=1, inpfrg=-1) for MNDO/d.

      a) Straight integral-direct linear-scaling calculation.
      b) Integral-direct linear-scaling run with special initial
         density guess (MNDO/d).
      c) CG-DMS search, conventional integrals.
      d) CG-DMS search, conventional integrals, final MOs needed.
      e) Integral-direct linear-scaling run, final MOs needed.
      f) Open-shell systems involved, do not run.

      Summary:
      -  46 out of 50 standard test jobs can be run presently.
      -  38 jobs pass the comparisons with the reference data (intdir=lindms=0)
         when using the standard criteria (see testjobs with intdir=lindms=0).
      -  08 jobs do not pass these comparisons under these citeria, but the
         deviations are minor and only reflect the limited numerical precision.
      -  Therefore the criteria are relaxed for the current test jobs by using
         higher thresholds (factor 5 for energies and 2 for gradient norms).
         43 jobs pass the comparisons under these criteria, while 3 jobs fail
         with slightly higher deviations.
      -  04 jobs cannot be run since they address open-shell systems.
         Note that job8a contains mostly closed-shell systems which show the usual
         minor deviations, but also some open-shell systems where the code fails.

==================================================================================

2.    Other test jobs
      ---------------
       
      Specific test jobs for the integral-direct linear-scaling code include:

      eth*  : MNDO, ethylene, energy and gradient, without SCF extrapolation.
      ethx* : MNDO, ethylene, energy and gradient, with SCF extrapolation.

      Options investigated:
      eth00 : intdir=0, lindms=0, inp24=1, nstart=-1 (standard calculation).
      eth01 : intdir=1, lindms=0, inp24=1, nstart=-1.
      eth10 : intdir=0, lindms=1, inp24=1, nstart=-1.
      eth11 : intdir=1, lindms=1, inp24=1, nstart=-1.
      ethx00: intdir=0, lindms=0, inp24=1, nstart= 0 (standard calculation).
      ethx01: intdir=1, lindms=0, inp24=1, nstart= 0.
      ethx10: intdir=0, lindms=1, inp24=1, nstart= 0.
      ethx11: intdir=1, lindms=1, inp24=1, nstart= 0.

      Input options from section 2.4 are identical in all runs.
      The ethylene test jobs are used to find basic errors in the code.

      All 8 jobs pass the comparisons with the reference data (intdir=lindms=0)
      under the standard criteria (see above).

==================================================================================

3.    Standard CHNO test set
      ----------------------

      227 molecules, MNDO, single-point SCF energies
      
      Comparison with reference calculations (intdir=0, lindms=0)
      using the standard input file $FS/eva/CHNO/chno/chno.inp

      Options investigated:
      chno00.scf*: intdir=0, lindms=0
      chno11.scf*: intdir=1, lindms=1
      chno11.frg*: intdir=1, lindms=1, linfrg=1, inpfrg=-1
      
      
      Results with intdir=1, lindms=1
      -------------------------------
      
      a) 214 molecules with correct results.
      
      b) 3 molecules which cannot work (half-electron SCF not available):
         ethylene D2d
         oxygen triplet
         oxygen singlet
      
      c) 2 molecules without SCF convergence (50 iterations):
         diethylperoxide C2
         diethylperoxide C2h
      
      d) 8 molecules converging to a wrong SCF solution:
         ozone                  charge=-2
         dimethylperoxide       charge=-2
         p-quinone              charge=-2
         N2O2 cis               charge=+2
         N2O2 trans             charge=+2
         N2O4 D2                charge=-2
         N2O4 D2h               charge=-2
         N2O4 D2d               charge=-2
      
      
      Results with intdir=1, lindms=1, linfrg=1, inpfrg=-1
      ----------------------------------------------------
      
      a) 224 molecules with correct results.
      
      b) 3 molecules which cannot work (half-electron SCF not available):
         ethylene D2d
         oxygen triplet
         oxygen singlet
      
      Obviously the use of a block-diagonal initial density matrix (obtained
      from one standard SCF iteration) is sufficient to avoid convergence to
      a wrong SCF solution.
