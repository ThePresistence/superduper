1.    Standard test jobs (from ~/mndo99/testjobs)
      -------------------------------------------

      There are 50 input files for test jobs which are designed to
      cover most of the major options in the program. These jobs are
      grouped as follows.

      job1*: Single-point SCF energy calculations for different methods.
      job2*: Single-point SCF energy and gradient calculations.
      job3*: SCF geometry optimizations and transition state searches.
      job4*: Force constant analysis (combined with optimizations).
      job5*: Reaction paths and grids.
      job6*: Calculations with correlated wave functions.
      job7*: Property evaluations.
      job8*: Special features.

      Options for running the standard test jobs:
      ------------------------------------------
      
      The current implementation of integral-direct linear-scaling methods
      using sparse matrices has the following limitations.

      Integral-direct mode (intdir.ge.1) does not work for:
      - Methods with orthogonalization corrections (OMx).
      - Electron correlation.
      - COSMO solvation treatment.
      - External point charges.

      Linear-scaling CG-DMS mode (lindms.ge.1) does not work for:
      - Open-shell systems.

      Linear-scaling CG-DMS mode requires:
      - Final eigenvectors (lindia=1) for properties etc
        which are currently not available for the sparse code (lindms=4).
      - Special initial density guess (linfrg=1, inpfrg=-1) for MNDO/d
        which is available for the sparse code (lindms=4).

      a) Straight integral-direct linear-scaling calculation.
      b) Integral-direct linear-scaling run with special initial
         density guess (MNDO/d).
      c) CG-DMS search, conventional integrals, do not run.
      d) CG-DMS search, conventional integrals, final MOs needed,
         do not run.
      e) Integral-direct linear-scaling run, final MOs needed,
         do not run.
      f) Open-shell systems involved, do not run.
      g) Standard density P(LM4) required for properties, do not run.

      Note: Only cases covered by footnotes a-b can be run when
      using intdir=4 and lindms=4 (as indicated in the table above).

      Special problems compared with intdir=1 and lindms=1:
      -  job4f: Block-diagonal guess for density required.

      Summary:
      -  32 out of 50 standard test jobs can be run presently.
      -  24 jobs pass the comparisons with the reference data (intdir=lindms=0)
         when using the standard criteria (see testjobs with intdir=lindms=0).
      -  08 jobs do not pass these comparisons under these citeria, but the
         deviations are minor and only reflect the limited numerical precision.
      -  Therefore the criteria are relaxed for the current test jobs by using
         higher thresholds (factor 5 for energies and 2 for gradient norms).
         29 jobs pass the comparisons under these criteria, while 3 jobs fail
         with slightly higher deviations.

==================================================================================

2.    Other test jobs
      ---------------
       
      Specific test jobs for the integral-direct linear-scaling code include:

      eth*  : MNDO, ethylene, energy and gradient, without SCF extrapolation.
      ethx* : MNDO, ethylene, energy and gradient, with SCF extrapolation.

      Options investigated:
      eth44 : intdir=4, lindms=4, inp24=1, nstart=-1.
      ethx44: intdir=4, lindms=4, inp24=1, nstart= 0.

      Input options from section 2.4 are identical in both runs.
      The ethylene test jobs are used to find basic errors in the code.

      Both jobs pass the comparisons with the reference data (intdir=lindms=0)
      under the standard criteria (see above).

3.    Standard CHNO test set

      227 molecules, MNDO, single-point SCF energies
      
      Comparison with reference calculations (intdir=0, lindms=0)
      using the standard input file $FS/eva/CHNO/chno/chno.inp

      Options investigated:

      Results with intdir=4, lindms=4
      -------------------------------
      
      a) 201 molecules with correct results.
      
      b) 3 molecules which cannot work (half-electron SCF not available):
         ethylene D2d
         oxygen triplet
         oxygen singlet
      
      c) 9 molecules without SCF convergence (50 iterations):

      d) 14 molecules converging to a wrong SCF solution:
         azomethane                  charge=-2
         diazirene                   charge=-2

         N2O2 trans                  charge=-6
         N2O4 D2                     charge=-6
         N2O4 D2h                    charge=-6
         N2O4 D2d                    charge=-6
         nitrous acid cis            charge= 0 excited state
      
      
      Results with intdir=4, lindms=4, linfrg=1, inpfrg=-1
      ----------------------------------------------------
      
      a) 224 molecules with correct results.
      
      b) 3 molecules which cannot work (half-electron SCF not available):
         ethylene D2d
         oxygen triplet
         oxygen singlet
      
      Obviously the use of a block-diagonal initial density matrix (obtained
      from one standard SCF iteration) is sufficient to avoid convergence to
      a wrong SCF solution.
