This subdirectory contains a suite of 8 MOPAC-type test jobs
which are used for validation of MNDO97. These test jobs
were taken from the public-domain MOPAC(6.0) software (QCPE).
They comprise a total of 143 MOPAC calculations. Using MOPAC
input files, MNDO97 performs 128 of these calculations while
some options in the remaining calculations are not available.
If this behaviour is encountered, the second condition for
the acceptance of a new program version is met.

Note that these jobs require very little cpu time and are not
suitable for benchmarking and performance measurements.

The test jobs and the validation procedure are described in the 
documentation (see file mndo97.doc).

The results from the independent programs MNDO97 and MOPAC(6.0)
agree well numerically (for details, see mndo97.doc). Note that
some constants and conversion factors were changed in MOPAC(7.0)
so that analogous comparisons between MNDO97 and MOPAC(7.0) are
expected to show slightly larger numerical deviations (unless the 
original constants and conversion factors are used in MOPAC(7.0)).

The reference results were generated using MNDO97 on a Silicon
Graphics workstation (R10000, IRIX(6.2)). The executable uses
machine library routines for BLAS2 and dgemm.

The test jobs combined require less than 10 seconds of cpu time
with this setup.
